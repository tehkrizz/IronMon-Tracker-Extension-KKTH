# Krizz-Kaizo-IronMon
This repo is for Krizz's custom patch for Pokemon FireRed v1.1 and an extension for the IronMon Tracker. This version of the ROM includes randomization, rule enforcement, and quality of life changes.

Check the releases for the patch/extension downloads. The extension is only expected to work with the patch part of the same release. When the patch is updated, the extension will be updated as well.

Check the wiki for the full list of changes.


## HIGHLIGHTS

### Built in randomizer!

### Quick start! 
  Spawn next to mom, talk to her for PC item and warp to lab. 
  Oak gives random mon instead of ball selection.

### Rule enforcement!
  If your mon faints, the game resets and deletes your save data.
  Cannot leave gyms/dojo once started
  Only TMs are gym rewards

### Quality of Life!
  “Package skip” by heading left at the end of route 1.
  
  Hidden items are pre-spawned (and only spawn once).
  
  Helper Nurses spread around the world to save time running back to centers (disabled if poisoned).
  
  HMs can be used without teaching move, so no HM buddy needed.
  
### Extensions!
  #### Default Choices Maker

  Default player name, gender, and rival name without additional patches. 
  #### Krizz’s Kaizo Tracker Helper
    
  Fixes ability tracking
  Allows favorites system for starting mon
